- [x] Create comprehensive API response models
- [ ] Implement base API client with authentication
- [ ] Add methods for:
  - [ ] Device configuration retrieval
  - [ ] Wireless settings management
  - [ ] Network settings access
  - [ ] System status queries

#### Data Models

  - [x] UnifiBaseModel
  - [x] BaseResponse
  - [x] Meta
- [x] Site models
- [x] Device configuration models
  - [x] Base mixins (ValidationMixin, NetworkMixin, etc.)
  - [x] Device model
  - [x] Client model
  - [x] PortStats model
  - [x] WifiStats model
  - [x] Comprehensive test coverage
- [🔄] Wireless settings models
  - [x] WifiMixin
  - [ ] Network profiles
  - [ ] Radio settings
  - [ ] WLAN configuration
- [ ] Network configuration models
- [ ] System status models

### Phase 2: Apple Recommendations Implementation [NOT STARTED]

#### Framework Development
- [ ] Create base check framework
  ```python
  class AppleRecommendationCheck:
      name: str
      description: str
      category: str
      severity: str
      async def check(self) -> CheckResult:
          pass
  ```
- [ ] Implement result reporting structure
- [ ] Add recommendation generation
- [ ] Create check categories:
  - [ ] Security checks
  - [ ] Wireless configuration checks
  - [ ] Network optimization checks
  - [ ] Performance monitoring checks

#### Check Implementation Priority

1. Security Fundamentals
   - [ ] WPA3/WPA2 configuration
   - [ ] PMF (Protected Management Frames)
   - [ ] Network isolation settings

2. Wireless Configuration
   - [ ] SSID configuration
   - [ ] Channel settings
   - [ ] Band configuration
   - [ ] Roaming settings (802.11k/v/r)

3. Network Settings
   - [ ] DHCP configuration
   - [ ] DNS settings
   - [ ] QoS/WMM settings
   - [ ] IP conflict detection

4. Performance & Monitoring
   - [ ] Client density monitoring
   - [ ] Signal strength analysis
   - [ ] Interference detection
   - [ ] Performance metrics collection

### Phase 3: Analysis & Reporting [NOT STARTED]

#### Analysis Features
- [ ] Network topology mapping
- [ ] Client connection analysis
- [ ] Performance bottleneck detection
- [ ] Configuration optimization suggestions

#### Reporting
- [ ] Generate comprehensive reports
- [ ] Create actionable recommendations
- [ ] Track changes over time
- [ ] Export capabilities

## Development Guidelines

1. **Testing**
   - Write tests before implementation
   - Maintain high test coverage
   - Use real API responses in tests

2. **Documentation**
   - Document all API endpoints
   - Maintain clear check descriptions
   - Keep recommendations up to date

3. **Code Quality**
   - Use type hints
   - Follow PEP 8
   - Maintain pre-commit hooks
