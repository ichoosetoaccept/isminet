- ✅ Create comprehensive API response models
- 🔄 Implement base API client with authentication
  - ✅ Base client with retry logic
  - ✅ SSL handling
  - ✅ Configuration management
  - 📦 Error handling improvements
  - 📦 Response type validation
- 📦 Implement UniFi client with methods for:
  - 📦 Device configuration retrieval
  - 📦 Wireless settings management
  - 📦 Network settings access
  - 📦 System status queries

#### Data Models [MOSTLY COMPLETE]
- ✅ Base response models
  - ✅ UnifiBaseModel
  - ✅ BaseResponse
  - ✅ Meta
- ✅ Site models
- ✅ Device configuration models
  - ✅ Base mixins (ValidationMixin, NetworkMixin, etc.)
  - ✅ Device model
  - ✅ Client model
  - ✅ PortStats model
  - ✅ WifiStats model
  - ✅ Comprehensive test coverage
- ✅ Wireless settings models
  - ✅ WifiMixin
  - ✅ RadioSettings with channel validation
  - ✅ NetworkProfile with security validation
  - ✅ WLANConfiguration
  - ✅ Comprehensive test coverage
- 📦 Network configuration models
- 📦 System status models

### Phase 2: Apple Recommendations Implementation [NOT STARTED]

#### Framework Development
- 📦 Create base check framework
  ```python
  class AppleRecommendationCheck:
      name: str
      description: str
      category: str
      severity: str
      async def check(self) -> CheckResult:
          pass
  ```
- 📦 Implement result reporting structure
- 📦 Add recommendation generation
- 📦 Create check categories:
  - 📦 Security checks
  - 📦 Wireless configuration checks
  - 📦 Network optimization checks
  - 📦 Performance monitoring checks

#### Check Implementation Priority

1. Security Fundamentals

   - 📦 PMF (Protected Management Frames)
   - 📦 Network isolation settings

2. Wireless Configuration
   - 📦 SSID configuration
   - 📦 Channel settings
   - 📦 Band configuration
   - 📦 Roaming settings (802.11k/v/r)

3. Network Settings
   - 📦 DHCP configuration
   - 📦 DNS settings
   - 📦 QoS/WMM settings
   - 📦 IP conflict detection

4. Performance & Monitoring
   - 📦 Client density monitoring
   - 📦 Signal strength analysis
   - 📦 Interference detection
   - 📦 Performance metrics collection

### Phase 3: Analysis & Reporting [NOT STARTED]

#### Analysis Features
- 📦 Network topology mapping
- 📦 Client connection analysis
- 📦 Performance bottleneck detection
- 📦 Configuration optimization suggestions

#### Reporting
- 📦 Generate comprehensive reports
- 📦 Create actionable recommendations
- 📦 Track changes over time
- 📦 Export capabilities

## Development Guidelines

1. **Testing**
   - Write tests before implementation
   - Maintain high test coverage
   - Use real API responses in tests

2. **Documentation**
   - Document all API endpoints
   - Maintain clear check descriptions
   - Keep recommendations up to date

3. **Code Quality**
   - Use type hints
   - Follow PEP 8
   - Maintain pre-commit hooks
