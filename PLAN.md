### Phase 2: Apple Recommendations Implementation [NEXT UP]

#### Framework Development [PLANNED]
- 📅 Create base check framework
  ```python
  class AppleRecommendationCheck:
      name: str
      description: str
      category: str
      severity: str
      async def check(self) -> CheckResult:
          pass
  ```
