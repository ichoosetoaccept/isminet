# Strategic Plan for Test and Validation Fixes

## Current Situation Analysis
- ✅ 149 tests in total
- ✅ 92% code coverage
- ✅ No mypy errors
- ✅ 3 expected pytest warnings (for test classes with __init__)

## Core Principles
- ✅ DRY code with helper methods for common operations
- ✅ Single Responsibility Principle
- ✅ Consistent validation behavior
- ✅ Clear error messages
- ✅ Type safety with mypy validation

## Fix Strategy

### Phase 1: Validation Mixins
- ✅ Fix MAC address validation
- ✅ Fix IPv4/IPv6 validation
- ✅ Fix netmask validation
- ✅ Fix version string validation

### Phase 2: System Models
- ✅ Fix SystemHealth required fields
- ✅ Fix SystemStatus validation
- ✅ Fix storage_usage type validation

### Phase 3: Network Models
- ✅ Fix VLAN configuration
- ✅ Fix IPv6 configuration validation
- ✅ Fix DHCP configuration validation

### Phase 4: Type Safety
- ✅ Run mypy on all files
- ✅ Fix UnifiClient type hints
- ✅ Fix response validation type hints
- ✅ Fix model type hints
- ✅ Fix test type hints

## Success Criteria
- ✅ All tests pass with consistent validation behavior
- ✅ Code coverage remains at 92%
- ✅ No mypy errors in any file (down from 10)
- ✅ No regression in existing functionality
- ✅ Clean up remaining pytest warnings

## Progress Monitoring
- ✅ Current failing tests: 0 (down from 17)
- ✅ Current coverage: 92% (up from 80%)
- ✅ Current mypy errors: 0 (down from 10)
- ✅ Current pytest warnings: 3 (expected warnings for test classes)
- ✅ No new issues reported
